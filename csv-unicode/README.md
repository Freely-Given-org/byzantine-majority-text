# Unicode versions of the Byzantine text in `.csv` format

This folder contains Unicode versions of the `.CCT` files in the `textonly-beta-code` folder, which are the original files produced by Prof. Robinson. The `.csv` files in this folder are provided to you merely as a convenience. Professor Robinson's `.CCT` files remain the ultimate source of truth.

The script used to convert the files from the Beta-encoded `.CCT` to the Unicode `.csv` is in the `scripts` folder (see that folder's README for details). That script generates `.csv`s of all the books of the New Testament (including the *Pericope Adulterae*, `PA.CCT`, and the verses from Acts 24, `ACT24.CCT`) and keeps two versions of each. The versions that include the textual variants are inside the `with-variants` folder, and the versions without textual variants are in the `no-variants` folder.
