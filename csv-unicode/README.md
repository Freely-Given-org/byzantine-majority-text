# Unicode versions of the Byzantine text in `.csv` format

This folder contains Unicode versions of the `.CCT` files in the `textonly-beta-code` folder (with accents) and the `.ASC` files in the `textonly-online-bible` folder (without accents,) which are the original files produced by Prof. Robinson. The `.csv` files in this folder are provided to you merely as a convenience. Professor Robinson's `.CCT` and `.ASC` files remain the ultimate source of truth.

The script used to convert the files to the Unicode `.csv`s is in the `scripts` folder (see that folder's README for details). There are two kinds of `.csv`s in the `csv-unicode` directory:

* `.csv`s of all the books of the New Testament (including the *Pericope Adulterae*, `PA.CCT`, and the verses from Acts 24, `ACT24.CCT`) **with accents and breathings**. There are two versions of each book. The versions that include the textual variants are inside the `with-variants` subfolder, and the versions without textual variants are in the `no-variants` subfolder.

* `.csv`s of all the books of the New Testament (**not** including the *Pericope Adulterae*, `PA.CCT` nor the verses from Acts 24, `ACT24.CCT`). These files **do not include accents nor breathings**.
