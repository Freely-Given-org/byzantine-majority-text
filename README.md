![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ByzTxt/byzantine-majority-text?style=for-the-badge)

## What is this?

This is the official GitHub home for [Dr. Maurice A. Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_A._Robinson)'s Greek
texts with morphological parsing and Strong's numbers.

This repo contains the Robinson-Pierpont edition of the Greek New
Testament in the Original Greek, Byzantine Majority Text. The 2005 edition of the text can be freely downloaded as a PDF file from The Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/newtestamentrobinsonpierpontbyzantine/).

Four versions are available:

1. A parsed version in Online Bible format with morphological parsing
codes, Strong's numbers, and tense-voice-mood numbers.

2. A "text only" version in Online Bible ASCII format.

3. A "text only" version in something akin to BETA Code, with accents,
breathings, diarheses, iota subscripts, Byzantine variants, and
a Nestle-Aland 27 collation.

4. A Unicode version of the BETA Code files. This version can be found in the `csv-unicode`
folder (see the `README` file there for more information.)
