# TEI-XML files of the Byzantine Textform

This folder contains XML files of the entire New Testament (inside the `BYZ` subfolder) and of each book. These files *do not contain accents nor variants* because they are derived from Professor Robinson's `.ASC` files. They represent the main text of the Byzantine Textform.

The files are converted with a script in the `scripts` folder (see there for more details). The source files are in the `textonly-online-bible`.
