# Scripts to convert the files to Unicode

You call it using `python3 converter.py` (or `python converter.py` depending on your particular settings.) It has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.8.

The script has dependencies, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
